My Personal Website Project
===========================

#Context

A couple of years ago, I had a personal website powered by <a href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank">Wordpress</a> and it used to work really well, even though it always was more than I needed. 

However, since I got to know about <a href="http://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, I realized that it would be the perfect solution for me, once it's simple, fast and its template engine <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki" target="_blank">Liquid</a> has got minimalism as part of its essence and I personally love it. 

#Customization 

I've substantially tweaked the base theme that ships with _Jekyll_ , and my intention now is to keep doing it until I get to what I consider to be the perfect scheme for what I need on my website. 

#The Page

Once it's done, I'm planning on reactivating my domain and start sharing content about stuff I work on in college as well as eventual projects I'll be doing for fun. The goal is to share good content on the web and contribute to the community of Computer Engineering students and professionals all over the globe, reason why I am gonna be writing in English. 

#The Link
If you want to access it to check out how it looks like, while I keep updating the layout, go to: <a href="http://tolribeiro.github.io/mywebsite" target="_blank">http://tolribeiro.github.io/mywebsite</a>

This is going to be a lot of fun, so let's do it!! :)
