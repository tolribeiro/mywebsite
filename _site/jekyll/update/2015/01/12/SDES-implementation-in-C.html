  <article class="post-content">
    <p>A few months ago, I went through a quite challenging experience as a student of an introdutory class on Criptography: I was required to give a presentation on <strong>DES</strong> algorithm.</p>

<p>After going through the titles of the reliable books on the subject, I decided to read <em>Criptography and Network Security</em> by William Stallings and one of the first sentences on that page got my attention: <em>”[…] the structure of DES and most symmetric ciphers is very complex and cannot be explained as easily […]”.</em> </p>

<p>Therefore, in the next paragraph, it said that studying a simplified version (SDES) would enhance understanding of DES, and I can guarantee that it actually does. After a couple of hours struggling in the beginning, I got the idea behind one of the most important symmetric ciphers algorithms.    </p>

<h1 id="the-implementation-in-c">The implementation in C</h1>

<p>Throughout the process of creating the presentation (which I did explaining the DES with a block size of 64 bits), I realized that the SDES would be better to make people understand the step-by-step bits manipulation involved, as well as it would help me to check if my answers on paper were right. As I didn’t find anything useful and “simple” enough for a demonstration,  I decided to do it myself.</p>
